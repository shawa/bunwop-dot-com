## A Clean Break

Imagine getting up out of bed, walking over to a desk, and, instead of opening up a keyboard-and-screen hinge thing, just sitting there and writing.

Some sort of wild breath-of-fresh-air novelty to have a pen in the hand instead of a keyboard shackle to emacs. To not have every single pen stroke consumed and digested by a mountain of typechecker-compiler-vcs monstrosity.

And when you can walk away from the book and leave it there and *forget about it*.


My dear me that would be real swell.
